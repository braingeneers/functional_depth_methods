# statdepth: Functional Depth Methods for Multivariate Time Series Data 
This package implements depth calculation methods for multivariate time-series data.

## 1. What is functional depth?
Functional depth, specifically band depth, is a generalization of the median to a set of functions. Given a set of functions (or curves), we'd answer the question: in what sense is a curve the most central? 

This method implements the theory proposed in the paper *On the Concept of Depth for Functional Data* by authors LÃ³pez-Pintado and Juan Romo. 

## 2. Development

To set up the development environment, run  
```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

To install locally, navigate to the download and run

```
pip install .
```

This code is written in Python, with most methods written in [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). It also uses [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), a high performance Python compiler. Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the speeds of C or FORTRAN, so this should remove any speed issues Python has. Depending on how this ends up being used, [dask](https://dask.org/) may also be implemented for parallelization. 

## 3. Usage

### i. Data Structure
Your data is indexed by time.  This is so our depth calculation can create a depth for each time increment, as well as across all time increments.  

Either your data is a set of real valued functions, or your data is a set of multivariate functions. We consider the two cases:

#### ii. Real-valued functions

Dataset example for a set of functions f_i: R --> R:
```Python
>>> df
     f_1  f_2  f_3  f_4  f_5
x_0    1    2    1    1    2
x_1    2    3    4    2    2
x_2    1    3    1    3    2
x_3    1    2    1    1    2
x_4    2    3    4    2    1

```

Each x_i is a timepoint, each column is a function f_i. In this case, we compute band depth using 

```Python 
from statdepth.depth import banddepth

banddepth([df], containment='r2', J=2)
```

Again, if a single item is passed in the list, *it is assumed we are in the univariate case*. This is because there is no way to detect internally where to "split" the DataFrame to isolate each function in the multivariate case. 

#### ii. Multivariate functions

In the case of **multivariate functions**, each DataFrame in a list should be a function where the *columns* are the *features* and the rows are the *time indices*. For example, if we had the three multivariate observations given by
```Python
>>> df1
       size  weight  co_amount
00:00   1.0       2          3
00:50   4.0       5          6
01:25   0.5       1          2
>>> df2
       size  weight  co_amount
00:00     3       2          1
00:50     5       4          3
01:25     1       1          0
>>> df3
       size  weight  co_amount
00:00   1.0       2          3
00:50   9.0      10          1
01:25   0.5       1          2

```

Then to compute band depth, we would use 

```Python
from statdepth.depth import banddepth

banddepth([df1, df2, df3], containment='r2_enum', J=2)
```

## 4. Containment

The methodology implemented here requires a notion of "containment" of a function f within the band defined by other functions. In R^2, we can check this pointwise. In higher dimensional space, there are more options. 

We have the following notions of containment:  
- `'r2'`: Standard pointwise interval containment
- `'r2_enum'`: Treats each component in our vector-valued function as a real-valued function, and then uses the standard pointwise interval definition.
- `'simplex'`: TODO  

#### i. Using an alternative definition of containment

To use your own definition of containment, simply pass a containment function into the `containment` parameter of `banddepth`. A containment function must be structured in the following way:

```Python
def containment(
    data: pd.DataFrame, 
    curve: Union[str, int], 
    relax=False
) -> float
```

The relaxation parameter is optional, and is used to relax the strict definition of containment into a definition that considers the proportion of time a function is contained in the band (or simplex). 

# 5. Methods

`banddepth(data: list, J=2, containment='r2', method='MBD')`:  

    Calculate the band depth for a set of functional curves.

    Band depth is an order statistic for functional data (see `fboxplot`), with
    a higher band depth indicating larger "centrality".  In analog to scalar
    data, the functional curve with highest band depth is called the median
    curve, and the band made up from the first N/2 of N curves is the 50%
    central region.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Functions to calculate band depth from. Each DataFrame should be an n x p matrix which is a function evaluated at all timepoints. 
    J: int (default=2)
        J parameter in the band depth calculation. J=3 can be computationally expensive for large datasets, and also does not have a closed form solution. 
    Containment: Callable or string
        Defines what containment means for the dataset. For functions from R-->R, we use the standard ordering on R. For higher dimensional spaces, we implement a simplex method. 
        A full list can be found in the README, as well as instructions on passing a custom definition for containment.  
    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Depth values for functional curves.
